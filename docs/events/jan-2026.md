Join us for an evening celebrating the life and work of [Daniel Johnston](https://hihowareyou.com/).

Daniel would have been 65 on the 22nd January, and because [we're probably not going to Austin, Texas to celebrate](https://www.hihowareyou.org/), we thought we might do it here instead.

Donations for this event will go to support a local organisation that makes Worry Monsters to support young adults with their well-being.

Friends of the Rumble will be performing covers of Daniel's songs along side some of their own offerings.

Confirmed artists included:
* [Augustin Bousfield](https://www.augustinbousfield.com/)
* [The Argent Grub](https://theargentgrub.co.uk/)
* (members of) [Billy Billy 5P](https://billybilly5p.bandcamp.com/)
* (members of) [The Mellon-Collies](https://mellon-collies.bandcamp.com/)
* (members of) [Bradford Sound Artists](https://bradfordsoundartists.org.uk/)

Expect the usual warm Rumble welcome at the excellent home of alternative music in Bingley, The Ryshworth Club.

## Daniel Johnston

An American singer, songwriter, musician, and artist.

Daniel Johnston spent the last 30 or so years of his life exposing his heartrending tales of unrequited love, cosmic mishaps, and existential torment to an ever-growing international cult audience. Initiates, including a healthy number of discerning musicians and critics, have hailed him as an American original in the style of bluesman Robert Johnson and country legend Hank Williams. A number of artists -- among them the Dead Milkmen, Yo La Tengo, the Velvet Underground's songs. And he as collaborated with the likes of Jad Fair (a founding member of Half Japanese, who've also done Daniel's songs), the Butthole Surfers, Bongwater/Shimmydisc guru Kramer, and members of Sonic Youth. Daniel gained his widest public exposure to date when, at the 1992 MTV Music Awards, Nirvana leader Kurt Cobain (who constantly touted Daniel in interviews) wore a Johnston T-shirt.
