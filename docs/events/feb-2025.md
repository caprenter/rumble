Doors: 19:30 <br>Pay What you Feel
{: class="doors"}

Two great contrasting bands for you this month at Rumble Up The Ryshworth.

We start with some ear crushing punk from locals **Queer Of Hearts** and end the evening with shoegazey, melodic, dreamy tunes from Leeds based, **Forming**.

We'll also have a bit of Northern Soul between bands from Anne-Marie on the record decks.
