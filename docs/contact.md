## Bands/Artists

If you'd like to play at Rumble Up The Ryshworth, please email or send us a link to:

* your Electronic Press Kit (EPK). (If you don't have one yet we think [this guide to making your EPK at the Careers In Music Website](https://www.careersinmusic.com/epk/) is pretty good.)
* your tech spec (what kit you need and or what gear you will bring) if that is not in your EPK.
