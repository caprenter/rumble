# About
Rumble Up The Ryshworth is set of Pay What You Feel gigs that brings Live Music from Alternative, Independent Artists to the Bingley area.

It is supported by [Bingley Music Town](https://bingleymusictown.org.uk/), an organisation that brings together the people that care about music in the area to make sure there are great musical opportunities for everyone now, and into the future.

# Pay What You Feel

**Pay What You Feel** means you can turn up even if you're skint. 

If you do want to pay, you can **pay on the night** by **cash** or **card** and **online via the links on each event page**.

Our costs are low, equipment is lent and donated, and the people running the event volunteer their time and skills.

**All the money we collect from donations goes to the bands.**<br>
(apart from the £20 we have to pay for the room)

You can also **support the bands directly** by buying their music and merch.

# Volunteer
We provide volunteering opportunities and experience for people in all aspects of live music events. [Get in touch]({% link contact.md %}) if you'd like to get involved.
