# Important Update Regarding Rumble Events

## From February 2026 The Rumble is moving to Bingley Arts Centre

We are aware of the recent announcement from the Ryshworth Club that they plan to close their doors from the 31st January 2026. 

Following discussions with Bingley Arts Centre, we're pleased to announce that they will be hosting our future events in the Theatre Upstairs.

In the meantime, we understand discussions about the future of the Ryshworth Club are on going. We'd love to help live music thrive there in th future if possible.

Thanks to all the amazing support from the staff at The Ryshworth & for your continued support and understanding during this transition — it means the world to us.
