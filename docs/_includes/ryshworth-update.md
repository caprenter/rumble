# Important Update Regarding future events

## From February 2026 our events are moving to the Theatre Upstairs at Bingley Arts Centre

We are sad that our home for the past year, the Ryshworth Club, is planning to close from the 31st January 2026. 

However, we're pleased to announce that we will be hosting our future events in the Theatre Upstairs at [Bingley Arts Centre](https://www.bingleyartscentre.co.uk/).

In the meantime, we understand discussions about the future of the Ryshworth Club are on going. We'd love to help live music thrive there in the future if possible.

Thanks to all the amazing support from the staff at the Ryshworth Club & for your continued support and understanding during this transition — it means the world to us.
