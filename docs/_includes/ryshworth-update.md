# Important Update Regarding Rumble Events.

We are aware of the recent announcement from the Ryshworth Club that they plan to close their doors from the 31st January 2026. 

While this is sad news, please rest assured that we are actively working on plans for taking the Rumble forward.

We've only existed for 12 months. In that time we've proved that there is a definite demand for keeping the music and community spirit alive.

We’ll share further details as soon as possible. 

Thanks to all the amazing support from the staff at The Ryshworth & for your continued support and understanding during this transition — it means the world to us.
